User research revealed a lack of clear information on what is recyclable, how certain materials should be recycled, and what happens after individuals dispose of recyclables, which is making many consumers unsure and untrusting of the recycling process. By providing more precise and accurate information, ECObuddy helps consumers make more sustainable and ethical purchases.</p> <button class="button">Learn More</button> </div>
